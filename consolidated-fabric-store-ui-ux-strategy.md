# Consolidated Fabric Store UI/UX Strategy

## Overview
This document presents a consolidated strategy for enhancing the fabric store's user experience by combining the strategic focus of the alternate plan with detailed implementation guidance. The approach is specifically tailored for a new venture without existing user data.

## Strategic Foundation (Phase 0)

Before implementing any features, we need to establish a strong foundation:

### 1. Heuristic & Expert Evaluation
- Conduct a formal heuristic evaluation of the planned user flows
- Identify potential usability issues early in the process
- Document findings for reference during implementation

### 2. Competitive Analysis
- Analyze leading online stores for luxury fabrics
- Understand market standards for combining specialist supplier functionality with luxury brand presentation
- Document key differentiators and opportunities

### 3. Proto-Persona Definition
- Work with project stakeholders to define 1-2 proto-personas
- Focus on primary user types: interior designers and discerning homeowners
- Document goals, pain points, and motivations

### 4. Define the UX Vision
- Synthesize findings into a guiding UX Vision statement
- Establish clear principles for brand feel and experience
- Use this vision as a north star for all design decisions

## Iterative Roadmap Approach

We'll adopt a themed-sprint approach focused on core user journeys:

### Foundational Principles (Ongoing)
These must be integrated into the "Definition of Done" for all work:

1. **Performance Optimization**
