# 🚀 Medusa.js v2 Multi-Store Go-Live Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Your platform consists of a Medusa v2 backend (deployed on Railway) and multiple frontend experiences, with the **fabric-store** as the priority go-live candidate. Based on the analysis of existing implementation plans, I'll consolidate a phased approach for production readiness.

## Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure Hardening (Week 1)
**Focus: Ensure Medusa backend is production-ready**

1. **Enable Redis modules** (currently commented in medusa-config.ts)
   - Activate cache, event-bus, and workflow-engine modules
   - Set up worker mode with MEDUSA_WORKER_MODE
   - Configure retry policies with exponential backoff and DLQ

2. **Migrate to Medusa Cart/Order System**
   - Replace custom file-backed orders with Medusa's native cart/order APIs
   - Implement idempotent checkout with Stripe webhook handlers
   - Add proper payment capture and reconciliation

3. **Configure Multi-tenancy via Sales Channels**
   - Create sales channels for each store/partner
   - Implement channel-scoped catalogs and pricing
   - Set up admin role guards per channel

4. **Set up Inventory & Reservations**
   - Enable inventory module with stock locations
   - Implement reservation on cart add
   - Configure release timeouts and reconciliation jobs

## Phase 2: Fabric Store Critical Features (Week 2)

## Phase 3: Commerce Flow Optimization (Week 3)
**Focus: Checkout and order management**

1. **Professional Checkout Experience**
   - Guest checkout optimization
   - Sample vs. yardage distinction in cart

## Phase 4: Performance & Security (Week 4)
**Focus: Production optimization**

1. **Observability & Monitoring**
   - Structured logging with Pino
   - OpenTelemetry instrumentation
   - P95 latency targets (cart <150ms, checkout <900ms)
   - Error tracking and alerting

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - SSR/ISR for critical pages
   - Image optimization with R2 signed URLs
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Core Web Vitals optimization

3. **Security Hardening**
