## üîç FRAMEWORK INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Medusa Native Payment System Analysis (60 minutes)

**Investigate Framework Payment Capabilities:**
1. Examine Medusa's built-in payment provider architecture
2. Review payment method configuration and processing workflows
3. Identify payment provider integration patterns and options
4. Document payment security and PCI compliance features

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How does Medusa handle payment provider integration and configuration?
- What payment processing workflows are built into the framework?
- How are payment methods managed and displayed to customers?
- What security and compliance features are provided by the framework?

**Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Examine existing payment configuration
find medusa/src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l "payment\|Payment" {} \;
grep -r "PaymentProvider\|PaymentService" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
grep -r "stripe\|paypal" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
```

**Framework Documentation Review:**
- Review Medusa v2 payment provider documentation
- Examine payment method configuration guides
- Study payment processing workflow documentation
- Investigate payment security and compliance guides

### Phase 2: Payment Provider Integration Assessment (30 minutes)

**Payment Provider Options:**
- Investigate Medusa's Stripe integration capabilities
- Review PayPal and other payment provider options
- Examine payment method variety support (cards, digital wallets, etc.)
- Assess multi-currency and international payment support

**Fabric Business Requirements:**
- Understand payment requirements for fabric purchases
- Review B2B payment options for wholesale fabric customers
- Assess subscription and recurring payment needs
- Identify payment reporting and reconciliation requirements

### Phase 3: Security and Compliance Strategy (30 minutes)

**Security Requirements:**

## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Design Principle: Framework Payment System Maximization
**Decision Rule**: Use Medusa's native payment system exclusively. Custom payment logic only for fabric-specific requirements not covered by framework.

### Payment Implementation Decision Tree

**Question 1**: Can fabric business payment requirements be met with Medusa's native payment providers?
- **YES** ‚Üí Configure payment providers using framework capabilities
- **NO** ‚Üí Investigate additional payment provider integrations

**Question 2**: Are payment processing workflows sufficient for fabric business model?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use Medusa's built-in payment processing workflows
- **NO** ‚Üí Investigate framework customization options for specific workflows

**Question 3**: Do security and compliance requirements align with framework capabilities?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use framework security and compliance features
- **NO** ‚Üí Plan additional security measures within framework patterns

### Payment Configuration Strategy

**Preferred Approach**: Native Payment Providers + Framework Workflows
- Configure payment providers using Medusa's native integration system
- Leverage framework's payment processing and security workflows
- Use framework's payment method management and display
- Integrate with framework's order processing and fulfillment

**Alternative Approach**: Extended Payment Configuration
- Use framework payment system as foundation
- Extend payment workflows for fabric-specific requirements
- Build additional payment method support within framework patterns
- Enhance payment reporting and analytics through framework mechanisms
