## üîç FRAMEWORK INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Medusa Native Tax System Analysis (60 minutes)

**Investigate Framework Tax Capabilities:**
1. Examine Medusa's built-in tax region and rate management
2. Review tax calculation engine and customization options
3. Identify tax provider integration patterns
4. Document regional tax configuration mechanisms

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How does Medusa handle multi-region tax configuration?
- What tax calculation capabilities are built into the framework?
- How are tax rates managed and updated in Medusa?
- What third-party tax service integrations are available?

**Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Examine existing tax configuration
find medusa/src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l "tax\|Tax" {} \;
grep -r "tax_rate\|TaxRate" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
grep -r "region\|Region" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
```

**Framework Documentation Review:**
- Review Medusa v2 tax documentation
- Examine tax region configuration guides
- Investigate tax provider plugin documentation
- Study tax calculation workflow documentation

### Phase 2: Third-Party Tax Service Integration Assessment (30 minutes)

**Tax Service Provider Options:**
- Investigate Medusa's TaxJar integration capabilities
- Review Avalara integration options
- Examine other tax service provider plugins
- Assess configuration vs custom development trade-offs

**Integration Pattern Analysis:**
- Understand tax service provider plugin architecture
- Review configuration requirements for tax providers
- Assess data flow between Medusa and tax services
- Document fallback and error handling patterns

### Phase 3: Regional Configuration Strategy (30 minutes)

**US Tax Requirement Mapping:**
- Map US state tax requirements to Medusa region capabilities
- Identify state-specific tax rule requirements
- Assess local/county tax handling needs
- Plan configuration approach for US tax compliance

## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Design Principle: Framework Tax System Maximization
**Decision Rule**: Use Medusa's native tax system exclusively. Custom tax logic only if framework cannot meet specific requirements.

### Tax Implementation Decision Tree

**Question 1**: Can US tax requirements be met with Medusa's native tax regions?
- **YES** ‚Üí Configure tax regions for each US state using framework
- **NO** ‚Üí Investigate third-party tax service provider integration

**Question 2**: Are tax calculations sufficiently accurate with basic tax rates?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use Medusa's built-in tax calculation engine
- **NO** ‚Üí Integrate with tax service provider (TaxJar/Avalara)

**Question 3**: Do local/county taxes require dynamic calculation?
- **YES** ‚Üí Required: Tax service provider integration for local tax accuracy
- **NO** ‚Üí State-level configuration sufficient, use framework regions

### Tax Configuration Strategy

**Preferred Approach**: Native Tax Regions + Tax Service Provider
- Configure US state regions using Medusa's native region management
- Integrate tax service provider for accurate rate calculation
- Leverage framework's tax calculation workflow
- Use framework's tax reporting and management features

**Alternative Approach**: Comprehensive Regional Configuration
- Create detailed tax regions for states and localities
- Manually configure tax rates using framework capabilities
- Build tax rate update procedures using framework APIs
- Monitor tax regulation changes and update configurations
