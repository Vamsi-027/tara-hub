## üîç FRAMEWORK INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Medusa v2 Entity Relationship Patterns (60 minutes)

**Investigate Framework Relationship Mechanisms:**
1. Examine how Medusa v2 handles entity relationships
2. Review existing product customization patterns
3. Identify entity extension mechanisms in framework
4. Document relationship definition and management patterns

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How does Medusa v2 handle custom entity relationships?
- What are the recommended patterns for extending core entities?
- How are relationships defined in the data model layer?
- What ORM relationship patterns does the framework support?

**Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Examine existing entity relationship patterns
find medusa/src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l "hasOne\|hasMany\|belongsTo" {} \;
grep -r "relationship" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
find medusa/src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l "model.define" {} \;
```

### Phase 2: Product Entity Extension Analysis (45 minutes)

**Framework Extension Patterns:**
- Investigate Medusa's recommended approach for extending Product entity
- Review subscriber patterns for entity lifecycle management
- Understand custom field addition mechanisms
- Document data migration and schema update patterns

**Admin UI Integration Patterns:**
- Examine how custom fields appear in admin interface
- Review admin UI customization mechanisms
- Identify form field integration patterns
- Document validation and persistence patterns

### Phase 3: Data Integrity and Migration Strategy (15 minutes)

**Framework Data Management:**
- Understand migration patterns for relationship additions
- Review data integrity enforcement mechanisms
- Identify rollback and recovery patterns
- Document testing strategies for entity relationships

---

## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Design Principle: Framework-Native Relationship Management
**Decision Rule**: Use Medusa's recommended patterns for entity relationships. Avoid direct entity modification that could complicate framework upgrades.

### Relationship Architecture Decision Tree

**Question 1**: Can the relationship be implemented using framework extension patterns?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use framework extension mechanisms (subscribers, custom fields)
- **NO** ‚Üí Investigate why, ensure requirement understanding is correct

**Question 2**: Does the relationship require core entity modification?
- **YES** ‚Üí Investigate framework-recommended extension patterns instead
- **NO** ‚Üí Proceed with relationship definition using framework patterns

**Question 3**: Can admin UI integration use framework customization mechanisms?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use framework admin UI extension patterns
- **NO** ‚Üí Plan minimal custom UI following framework conventions

### Relationship Implementation Strategy

**Preferred Approach**: Entity Extension via Framework Patterns
- Use Medusa v2 entity extension mechanisms
- Leverage framework relationship definitions
- Follow framework data migration patterns
- Integrate with framework admin UI customization

**Alternative Approach**: Custom Relationship Entity
- Create linking entity if framework extension insufficient
- Use framework service patterns for relationship management
- Maintain data integrity through framework mechanisms
- Provide admin interface through framework patterns
