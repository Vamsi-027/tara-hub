## üîç FRAMEWORK INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Medusa Native Fulfillment System Analysis (60 minutes)

**Investigate Framework Shipping Capabilities:**
1. Examine Medusa's built-in fulfillment and shipping zone management
2. Review shipping option configuration and calculation patterns
3. Identify shipping provider integration mechanisms
4. Document shipping calculation customization options

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How does Medusa handle shipping zone and option configuration?
- What shipping calculation engines are built into the framework?
- How are shipping providers integrated with Medusa v2?
- What customization options exist for shipping calculations?

**Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Examine existing shipping configuration
find medusa/src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l "shipping\|fulfillment" {} \;
grep -r "ShippingOption\|FulfillmentProvider" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
grep -r "shipping_zone\|service_zone" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
```

**Framework Documentation Review:**
- Review Medusa v2 fulfillment documentation
- Examine shipping provider plugin architecture
- Study shipping calculation workflow documentation
- Investigate shipping zone configuration guides

### Phase 2: Shipping Provider Integration Assessment (30 minutes)

**Shipping Provider Options:**
- Investigate built-in shipping provider capabilities
- Review third-party shipping provider integrations (UPS, FedEx, USPS)
- Examine shipping rate calculation options
- Assess real-time vs configured rate trade-offs

**Fabric-Specific Requirements:**
- Understand dimensional weight calculation capabilities
- Review handling requirements for fabric shipments
- Assess special packaging and protection needs
- Identify fabric roll vs cut fabric shipping differences

### Phase 3: Shipping Zone Strategy for US Coverage (30 minutes)

**US Shipping Requirement Mapping:**
- Map US shipping zones to Medusa zone capabilities
- Identify state-specific shipping requirements
- Assess rural vs urban delivery considerations
- Plan shipping option configuration for fabric products

## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Design Principle: Framework Fulfillment System Maximization
**Decision Rule**: Use Medusa's native fulfillment system exclusively. Custom shipping logic only for fabric-specific requirements not covered by framework.

### Shipping Implementation Decision Tree

**Question 1**: Can US shipping requirements be met with Medusa's native shipping zones?
- **YES** ‚Üí Configure shipping zones for US regions using framework
- **NO** ‚Üí Investigate shipping provider integration for enhanced capabilities

**Question 2**: Are shipping calculations sufficiently accurate with basic rate configuration?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use Medusa's built-in shipping calculation engine
- **NO** ‚Üí Integrate with shipping provider for real-time rate calculation

**Question 3**: Do fabric-specific requirements need custom calculation logic?
- **YES** ‚Üí Investigate framework customization options before building custom logic
- **NO** ‚Üí Standard framework shipping configuration sufficient

### Shipping Configuration Strategy

**Preferred Approach**: Native Shipping Zones + Provider Integration
- Configure US shipping zones using Medusa's native zone management
- Integrate shipping provider for accurate rate calculation
- Leverage framework's shipping calculation workflow
- Use framework's shipping option and fulfillment management

**Alternative Approach**: Comprehensive Zone Configuration
- Create detailed shipping zones for US regions
- Configure shipping rates using framework capabilities
- Build shipping calculation customizations within framework patterns
- Manage shipping options through framework interfaces
