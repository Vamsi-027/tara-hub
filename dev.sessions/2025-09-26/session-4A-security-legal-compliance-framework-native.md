## üîç FRAMEWORK INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Medusa Native Security Features Analysis (75 minutes)

**Investigate Framework Security Capabilities:**
1. Examine Medusa's built-in authentication and authorization systems
2. Review data protection and encryption capabilities
3. Identify API security and rate limiting features
4. Document audit logging and monitoring mechanisms

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How does Medusa handle user authentication and session management?
- What data protection and encryption features are built into the framework?
- How are API security and rate limiting implemented?
- What audit logging and monitoring capabilities exist?

**Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Examine existing security configuration
find medusa/src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l "auth\|security\|encrypt" {} \;
grep -r "middleware\|guard\|protect" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
grep -r "audit\|log\|monitor" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
```

**Framework Documentation Review:**
- Review Medusa v2 security documentation
- Examine authentication and authorization guides
- Study data protection and privacy compliance guides
- Investigate security monitoring and audit capabilities

### Phase 2: Legal Compliance Framework Assessment (45 minutes)

**Compliance Requirements Mapping:**
- Map GDPR requirements to Medusa data handling capabilities
- Review PCI compliance through payment system integration
- Assess fabric industry regulation compliance needs
- Identify data retention and privacy policy requirements

**Framework Compliance Features:**
- Understand Medusa's data export and deletion capabilities
- Review customer consent management features
- Assess data anonymization and pseudonymization options
- Examine compliance reporting and audit features

### Phase 3: Security Monitoring and Incident Response (30 minutes)

**Security Operations:**

## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Design Principle: Framework Security and Compliance Maximization
**Decision Rule**: Use Medusa's native security and compliance features exclusively. Custom security implementations only for gaps not covered by framework.

### Security Implementation Decision Tree

**Question 1**: Can security requirements be met with Medusa's native security features?
- **YES** ‚Üí Configure security using framework capabilities
- **NO** ‚Üí Investigate security extensions that integrate with framework patterns

**Question 2**: Are compliance requirements addressable through framework data handling?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use Medusa's built-in compliance and data protection features
- **NO** ‚Üí Plan compliance enhancements within framework security patterns

**Question 3**: Do monitoring and audit requirements align with framework capabilities?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use framework audit logging and monitoring systems
- **NO** ‚Üí Plan monitoring extensions that integrate with framework systems

### Security Configuration Strategy

**Preferred Approach**: Native Security + Compliance Configuration
- Configure security using Medusa's native authentication and authorization
- Leverage framework's data protection and privacy features
- Use framework's audit logging and monitoring capabilities
- Integrate compliance requirements with framework data handling

**Alternative Approach**: Extended Security Configuration
- Use framework security as foundation
- Extend security features for specific compliance requirements
- Build additional monitoring within framework patterns
- Enhance audit capabilities through framework mechanisms
