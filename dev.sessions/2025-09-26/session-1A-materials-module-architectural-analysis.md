## üéØ BUSINESS CONTEXT & REQUIREMENTS

### Current Situation
- Materials module disabled in medusa-config.ts due to deployment error
- No fabric inventory management through proper Medusa workflow
- Temporary workarounds affecting business operations

### Business Objectives
- Re-enable materials module using Medusa v2 standards
- Establish fabric inventory management foundation
- Ensure production-grade quality and maintainability

### Success Criteria
- Materials module operational within Medusa framework
- Zero custom infrastructure that duplicates framework capabilities
- Clean integration with existing Medusa patterns

---

## üîç FRAMEWORK INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Medusa v2 Service Factory Investigation (30 minutes)

**Investigate Existing Patterns:**
1. Examine `/medusa/src/modules/` for existing module patterns
2. Review how other modules use `MedusaService` factory
3. Identify data model definition patterns using `model.define()`
4. Document service registration and dependency injection patterns

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How do existing modules structure their services?
- What auto-generated methods does `MedusaService` provide?
- How are models defined and exported in Medusa v2?
- What are the naming conventions for CRUD operations?

**Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Examine existing module patterns
find medusa/src -name "service.ts" -exec head -20 {} \;
find medusa/src -name "models.ts" -exec head -15 {} \;
grep -r "MedusaService" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
```

### Phase 2: Framework Capabilities Assessment (45 minutes)

**Service Factory Capabilities:**
- Document what CRUD methods are auto-generated
- Understand pagination and filtering mechanisms
- Identify query building and optimization features
- Map validation and error handling patterns

**Data Layer Investigation:**
- Review ORM integration patterns
- Understand transaction management
- Identify caching capabilities
- Document performance optimization features

**Module Registration Analysis:**
- Examine dependency injection patterns
- Understand module lifecycle management
- Review configuration and initialization patterns

## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Design Principle: Framework Maximization
**Decision Rule**: If Medusa provides it, use it. Custom code only for true business logic gaps.

### Service Architecture Decision Tree

**Question 1**: Does MedusaService provide the required CRUD operations?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use auto-generated methods, add only business-specific logic
- **NO** ‚Üí Investigate why, ensure requirement is correctly understood

**Question 2**: Can business logic be implemented as simple methods on the service?
- **YES** ‚Üí Add methods to service class extending MedusaService
- **NO** ‚Üí Re-examine requirement for framework alignment

**Question 3**: Does the requirement need custom data access patterns?
- **YES** ‚Üí Investigate if requirement can be met with framework query builders
- **NO** ‚Üí Use standard MedusaService patterns

### Quality Architecture Constraints

**Performance Constraints:**
- All database operations must use framework ORM
- No raw SQL unless absolutely necessary
- Leverage framework caching mechanisms

**Maintainability Constraints:**
- Follow established naming conventions
- Use framework error handling patterns
- Integrate with framework logging and monitoring

**Security Constraints:**
- Use framework authentication/authorization
- Follow framework input validation patterns
- Leverage framework security middleware

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS

### Framework Compliance Requirements

**Service Implementation:**
- MUST extend `MedusaService({ ModelName })`
- MUST use auto-generated CRUD methods where possible
- MUST follow framework naming conventions
- MUST integrate with framework dependency injection

**Model Definition:**
- MUST use `model.define()` from framework utils
- MUST follow framework field type patterns
- MUST use framework relationship definitions

**Error Handling:**
- MUST use framework error base classes
- MUST provide structured error information
- MUST integrate with framework logging

**Testing:**
- MUST use framework testing utilities
- MUST test framework integration points
- MUST validate against framework patterns

### Anti-Pattern Prevention

**Forbidden Approaches:**
- ‚ùå Direct database access bypassing framework
- ‚ùå Custom ORM or query building
- ‚ùå Parallel systems that duplicate framework features
- ‚ùå Manual transaction management
- ‚ùå Custom authentication/authorization

**Required Approaches:**
- ‚úÖ Framework service factory pattern
- ‚úÖ Framework-provided CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Framework data model definitions
- ‚úÖ Framework error handling patterns
- ‚úÖ Framework testing utilities
