## üîç FRAMEWORK INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Medusa Native Inventory System Analysis (60 minutes)

**Investigate Framework Inventory Capabilities:**
1. Examine Medusa's built-in inventory management and tracking
2. Review stock level calculation and reservation mechanisms
3. Identify inventory location and warehouse management features
4. Document product variant inventory tracking patterns

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How does Medusa handle inventory tracking and stock levels?
- What reservation and allocation mechanisms are built into the framework?
- How are inventory locations and warehouses managed?
- What product variant inventory capabilities exist?

**Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Examine existing inventory configuration
find medusa/src -name "*.ts" -exec grep -l "inventory\|stock" {} \;
grep -r "InventoryService\|InventoryLevel" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
grep -r "reservation\|allocation" medusa/src --include="*.ts"
```

**Framework Documentation Review:**
- Review Medusa v2 inventory management documentation
- Examine stock level calculation and tracking guides
- Study inventory reservation and allocation workflows
- Investigate multi-location inventory support

### Phase 2: Fabric-Specific Inventory Requirements Assessment (30 minutes)

**Fabric Inventory Characteristics:**
- Understand fabric roll vs cut inventory tracking needs
- Review fabric length/quantity measurement requirements
- Assess fabric quality and grade tracking needs
- Identify fabric remnant and waste management requirements

**Stock Level Calculation:**
- Understand how fabric quantities relate to product variants
- Review fabric measurement unit conversions (yards, meters, etc.)
- Assess partial quantity availability calculations
- Identify minimum order quantity considerations

### Phase 3: Integration Requirements with Materials System (30 minutes)

**Materials Integration:**
- Map inventory tracking to materials from Sessions 1A-1C
- Understand product-material relationship inventory implications
- Assess inventory reporting and analytics requirements
- Plan integration with order workflow and reservation system

## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Design Principle: Framework Inventory System Maximization
**Decision Rule**: Use Medusa's native inventory management exclusively. Custom inventory logic only for fabric-specific calculations not covered by framework.

### Inventory Implementation Decision Tree

**Question 1**: Can fabric inventory requirements be met with Medusa's native inventory tracking?
- **YES** ‚Üí Configure inventory system using framework capabilities
- **NO** ‚Üí Investigate framework extension options for fabric-specific needs

**Question 2**: Are stock calculations sufficiently accurate with framework mechanisms?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use Medusa's built-in inventory calculation engine
- **NO** ‚Üí Investigate framework customization options for fabric calculations

**Question 3**: Do fabric measurement units integrate with framework inventory?
- **YES** ‚Üí Use framework product variant and inventory management
- **NO** ‚Üí Plan fabric unit conversion within framework patterns

### Inventory Configuration Strategy

**Preferred Approach**: Native Inventory + Fabric Configuration
- Configure inventory management using Medusa's native capabilities
- Adapt fabric-specific requirements to framework inventory patterns
- Leverage framework's stock level calculation and reservation system
- Use framework's inventory reporting and analytics features

**Alternative Approach**: Extended Inventory Configuration
- Use framework inventory as foundation
- Extend inventory calculations for fabric-specific requirements
- Build fabric measurement conversions within framework patterns
- Maintain fabric inventory metadata through framework mechanisms
