# Top 5 "Must-Have" Features for Go-Live

Based on the goal to go-live ASAP, here are the top 5 essential features to implement for the `fabric-store`. This plan focuses on creating a professional, trustworthy, and functional e-commerce experience.

### 1. Homepage Revamp & Content Strategy
*   **Why:** The homepage is your digital storefront. It must immediately build trust, showcase your brand, and guide customers to products. A weak homepage leads to high bounce rates.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A compelling hero section with a strong call-to-action (e.g., "Discover artisanal fabrics").
    *   Visually distinct sections for "Featured Collections," "New Arrivals," or "Best Sellers."
    *   Incorporate brand storytelling: briefly mention what makes your fabrics unique.
    *   Use high-quality imagery that reflects the quality of your products.

### 2. Advanced Product Discovery (Search & Filtering)
*   **Why:** Customers will leave if they can't find what they're looking for. For a product like fabric, filtering by specific attributes is not just a feature, it's a core part of the shopping experience.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A prominent, functional search bar in the header.
    *   A product gallery page with faceted filters for essential attributes: **Fabric Type** (e.g., Linen, Velvet), **Color**, **Use** (e.g., Upholstery, Apparel), and **Price Range**.
    *   Sorting options (e.g., Newest, Price: Low to High).

### 3. Comprehensive Product Detail Page (PDP)
*   **Why:** This is where the purchase decision is made. Since customers can't touch the fabric, this page must provide all necessary details to create confidence.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   High-resolution, multi-angle product images with zoom functionality.
    *   Detailed product information: price per yard/meter, material composition, fabric width, weight (GSM), and care instructions.
    *   Clear "Add to Cart" and **"Order a Sample"** buttons. The ability to order samples is crucial for this business.
    *   Display inventory status ("In Stock", "Low Stock") to create urgency.

### 4. Streamlined Cart & Checkout Flow
*   **Why:** This is the most critical flow for revenue. A confusing or lengthy process is the primary cause of abandoned carts.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   An accessible mini-cart or fly-out panel to easily review items.
    *   A dedicated `/cart` page to adjust quantities and see a final price breakdown (subtotal, shipping, taxes).
    *   A clean, multi-step checkout process (e.g., 1. Shipping, 2. Payment, 3. Review) that integrates with the backend's existing Stripe payment provider.

### 5. Customer Account & Order History
*   **Why:** This is fundamental for post-purchase trust and customer service. Users expect to be able to view their order status and history.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Leverage the existing authentication for a simple sign-in/sign-up process.
    *   A protected `/account` route.
    *   Inside the account section, a clear list of past orders with their status (e.g., "Processing," "Shipped"), date, and total amount.
