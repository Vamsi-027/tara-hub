# Cleanup Summary

## What Was Removed
All previous session files and overengineered implementations have been removed.

## What We Kept
- Simple materials module (3 files, ~50 lines total)
- Clear implementation plan
- Structured task list

## Key Simplifications

### Before (Overengineered)
- 6,376 lines of code
- Complex composition parsing
- Material types and enums
- Business logic in data module
- Direct product creation

### After (Clean)
- ~50 lines for materials module
- Simple one-to-one data sync
- JSON properties field
- Business logic in fabric-products
- Standard Medusa patterns

## Current Architecture

```
materials/              # Simple data storage
├── models.ts          # id, name, properties
├── service.ts         # extends MedusaService
└── index.ts           # module definition

fabric-products/       # User features
├── models/            # Configuration models
├── migrations/        # SQL schemas (needs fixing)
├── service.ts         # Selection logic
└── index.ts           # module definition

links/                 # Relationships (to be created)
└── product-material.link.ts

workflows/             # Business logic (to be created)
└── material-selection.workflow.ts
```

## Next Steps
1. Implement materials sync from admin
2. Fix fabric-products to use materials table
3. Remove fabric-details module
4. Create product-material links
5. Build selection workflows

## Benefits Achieved
- 99% reduction in code complexity
- Clear separation of concerns
- Following Medusa best practices
- Maintainable and extensible
- No overengineering
