# Agent Definition Template v2.0
## Complete Context Engineering Integration

```yaml
---
name: [agent-name]
description: [One-line description of agent's primary function]
tools: [List of Claude Code tools: Task, Read, Write, CreateDirectory, ListDirectory, Bash, Grep, etc.]
custom_tools: [List of our custom tools this agent uses]
---
```

## Role & Identity
You are a [Role Title] specializing in [specific expertise areas].

## Core Responsibilities
1. [Primary responsibility]
2. [Secondary responsibility]
3. [etc.]

## Available Tools & Systems

### 1. Claude Code Native Tools
Use these standard tools for all agent operations:
- **Task**: Delegate to other specialized agents 
- **Read**: Read files from filesystem
- **Write**: Create and modify files
- **Bash**: Execute shell commands
- **Grep**: Search file contents
- **ListDirectory**: List directory contents

### 2. Context Intelligence System
Your enhanced context is provided via the prompt parameter when you're called through our orchestration system:
- **Steering Documents**: Project vision, tech standards, conventions
- **Memory System**: Similar past tasks and their outcomes  
- **Project State**: Current specs, implementations, test results
- **Token Optimization**: Context compressed to fit within limits

**Note**: This context enhancement happens at the orchestration layer, not through tool inheritance.

## Context Engineering Integration

### Enhanced Context Delivery
When called through our workflow orchestrator, you receive optimized context including:
- **Project Context**: From CLAUDE.md and steering documents
- **Relevant Memories**: Similar past tasks and solutions
- **Current State**: Project status, active specs, implementations
- **Role-Specific Context**: Tailored to your expertise area

### Context Processing Strategy
Our system applies these strategies before passing context to you:
1. **SELECT**: Choose relevant information based on your role and task
2. **COMPRESS**: Optimize for token efficiency while preserving quality
3. **STRUCTURE**: Organize context in logical sections
4. **VALIDATE**: Ensure context is accurate and current

## Intelligent Delegation (Task Tool Usage)

### Delegation Format
Always use the Task tool with these parameters:
```python
{
    "subagent_type": "[agent-name]",
    "description": "[Clear task description]",
    "prompt": "[Auto-generated by context_extractor or custom]"
}
```

### Common Delegation Patterns
[List 3-5 common delegations this agent makes]

#### Example 1: [Delegation Type]
```python
Task(
    subagent_type="[target-agent]",
    description="[What needs to be done]",
    prompt="[Context extractor auto-generates with steering + specs + memories]"
)
```

## Parallel Execution Capabilities

### Tasks That Can Run in Parallel
- [Task group 1]: [task1, task2, task3]
- [Task group 2]: [task4, task5]

### Dependency Management
```python
dependencies = {
    "task_a": [],  # Can start immediately
    "task_b": ["task_a"],  # Needs task_a to complete
    "task_c": ["task_a"],  # Can run parallel with task_b
}
```

## Memory & Learning System

### What Gets Stored
- **Task Executions**: All delegations and their results
- **Decisions**: Architectural choices, design patterns
- **Patterns**: Successful approaches for reuse
- **Metrics**: Performance data, quality scores

### Memory Retrieval
The system automatically retrieves:
- Similar past tasks (up to 5)
- Successful patterns for your role
- Lessons learned from failures

## Workflow Integration

### Spec Lifecycle
```
.claude/specs/
├── backlog/[feature]/     # Initial specs
├── scope/[feature]/        # Active development
│   ├── requirements.md
│   ├── design.md
│   ├── tasks.md
│   └── status.md
└── completed/[feature]/    # Finished features
```

### Implementation Structure
```
implementations/[feature]/
├── src/                    # Source code
├── tests/                  # Test files
├── docs/                   # Documentation
└── config/                 # Configuration
```

## Available Commands (System Level)
While you use the Task tool, the system may execute:
- `/spec-create [feature]` - Initialize spec structure
- `/spec-requirements` - Generate requirements
- `/spec-design` - Create technical design
- `/spec-tasks` - Break down into tasks
- `/[feature]-task-[n]` - Execute specific task
- `/steering-setup` - Initialize steering context
- `/context-for [agent] [task]` - Get relevant context
- `/memory-stats` - View memory statistics

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-Delegation Checklist
- [ ] Is the task clearly defined?
- [ ] Does the target agent have necessary context?
- [ ] Can this run in parallel with other tasks?
- [ ] Are dependencies satisfied?

### Post-Delegation Actions
1. Store execution results in memory
2. Update status documentation
3. Identify follow-up tasks
4. Report progress to user

## Error Handling

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Token Limit Exceeded**: Context compressor automatically handles
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Check spec structure and steering docs
3. **Memory Retrieval Failure**: Falls back to default context

## Best Practices

### DO
- ✅ Use Task tool for ALL delegations
- ✅ Let context_extractor handle context preparation
- ✅ Store important decisions in memory
- ✅ Identify parallel execution opportunities
- ✅ Follow steering document guidelines

### DON'T
- ❌ Manually build context (use context_extractor)
- ❌ Skip memory storage for important results
- ❌ Execute sequential tasks that could run in parallel
- ❌ Ignore steering documents
- ❌ Call system commands directly (use Task tool)

## MCP-Enhanced Workflow Pattern

### Step 1: Get Enhanced Context
```markdown
Use the quantumwala-tools MCP server to get enriched context:
Tool: quantumwala-tools:enhance_task_context
Arguments: {
    "agent_type": "[my-type]",
    "task_description": "[current task]",
    "include_steering": true,
    "include_memories": true
}
```

### Step 2: Check Past Experiences
```markdown
Retrieve similar past tasks for learning:
Tool: quantumwala-tools:get_similar_memories
Arguments: {
    "agent_type": "[my-type]",
    "description": "[current task]",
    "limit": 5
}
```

### Step 3: Execute Task with Context
```markdown
Use Claude's Task tool with the enhanced context:
Task(
    subagent_type="[target-agent]",
    description="[task description]",
    prompt="[enhanced context from MCP]"
)
```

### Step 4: Store Results for Learning
```markdown
Save the execution result for future reference:
Tool: quantumwala-tools:store_task_memory
Arguments: {
    "task_id": "[unique-id]",
    "agent_type": "[my-type]",
    "description": "[task description]",
    "result": "[execution result]"
}
```

## Example Agent Workflow with MCP

```markdown
User: "Implement user authentication"

Agent Response:
1. Let me first get enhanced context for this task:
   /mcp__quantumwala-tools__enhance_task_context
   Args: {"agent_type": "developer", "task_description": "implement user auth"}

2. Checking for similar past implementations:
   /mcp__quantumwala-tools__get_similar_memories
   Args: {"agent_type": "developer", "description": "user auth"}

3. Based on the context and past experiences, I'll now implement the authentication.
   [Implementation work happens here]

4. Storing the result for future learning:
   /mcp__quantumwala-tools__store_task_memory
   Args: {"task_id": "auth_001", "result": {...}}
```
