You are an expert sr. product manager, engineer, marketing , GTM and product strategist. Analyze the codebase and produce a **precision product roadmap** that will take this platform to **\$50M ARR potential**. Work from code evidence first; when you hypothesize, label it **Working Theory**.

**Context**

* **Tech stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js (routes/app), React, Medusa.js (headless commerce), Sanity CMS, PostgreSQL, Cloudflare R2, Redis.
* **Product objectives / use cases**:

 1. AI Agentic E-commerce for SMBs
 2. Agent↔Agent (A2A) workflows
 3. Business→Agent (B2A) automation (e.g., “optimize my Etsy store, sync catalog, auto-price, generate images, answer customers”)
 4. Agent→Business (A2B) actions (quotations, negotiations, RFQs, PO/fulfillment)
 5. Multi-tenant web & mobile storefronts for partners: (1) Custom Cushion Makers, (2) Interior Designers, (3) Fabric Manufacturers/Suppliers, (4) Marketing Agencies, (5) Influencers  
6. Marketplace + collaboration hub across all stakeholders. Partnerships enablement between different stakeholders.
7. Multiple AI Agents for SMB E-commerce ( ex: Marketing, Sales, Sourcing, Lead Generation)
8. Production System for SMB , Manufacturing or workshop 
9. Lead Generation, Social Media Marketing, Email marketing, SMS Marketing and other marketing channels. Partnering with Agencies for Marketing
10. Campaigns Management, Marketing Calendar Management
11. Vault for managing the files, docs and other digital assets
12. B2B tools ; quotation management, project planning, pricing management
13. Ability to create products to publish into e-commerce store rapidly
14. SEO Improvements to Storefront
15. Create and Publish Blogs automatically

**Inputs (fill these before running):**

* REPO: \repos\tara-hub-1\
* ROOT\_DIR: \repos\tara-hub-1\
* MONOREPO?: Yes
* ENV/OPS DOCS (if any): 

**What to do (method):**

1. **Map the system from code**

   * List packages/apps, main services, entrypoints, Next.js routing mode(s), Nest.js modules, Medusa plugins/customizations, Sanity schemas, DB schema objects, Redis usage, R2 buckets.
   * Build a dependency graph and a request flow for: product detail page, cart/checkout, catalog sync, image upload, and any agent/automation flows discovered.
   * Output a **file-path-cited inventory** of APIs (HTTP/RPC), background jobs/queues, webhooks, and cron/schedulers.

2. **Current capability vs. objective matrix**

   * For each objective/use case above, mark **Supported / Partial / Missing** and cite code paths.
   * Identify multi-tenant boundaries (tenant ID propagation, row-level security, schema strategy). If missing, flag as **Gap**.

3. **Gap analysis (engineering + product)**

   * Architecture gaps: agent orchestration, eventing, idempotency, retries, dead-letter handling, observability, authN/Z, rate limits, SLOs.
   * Product gaps: partner onboarding, catalog ingestion (CSV/API), Etsy/marketplace syncs, pricing engine, image/asset pipelines, negotiation/RFQ flows, roles/permissions, billing.
   * Data gaps: Postgres normalization vs. query patterns, search (facets), caching strategy, migration hygiene, PII/PCI boundaries.
   * For each gap, provide **impact**, **effort (S/M/L)**, **evidence (files)**, and **remediation**.

4. **Target architecture (code-adjacent)**
   Propose an incrementally adoptable design that fits the stack:

   * **Agent core** (tool-calling service) with **job queue (Redis)**, **state store (Postgres)**, **skills/tools registry**, and **human-in-the-loop (HITL)** checkpoints.
   * **Event bus** using Redis Streams/ pub-sub for agent events, catalog sync, order lifecycle.
   * **Multi-tenant enforcement** (tenant\_id, RLS or application-level guards), audit log, rate limiting.
   * **Commerce plane** (Medusa customizations, pricing service, tax/shipping, payment providers).
   * **Content plane** (Sanity schemas for landing, PLP/PDP content, partner pages), ISR/revalidation strategy in Next.js.
   * **Asset plane** (R2 storage, signed URLs, image transforms).
   * **Observability** (structured logs, traces, metrics dashboards, P95 latency & error budgets).
     Output a diagram in text (components + arrows) and explain how it evolves from current code.

5. **\$50M revenue model & growth levers (Working Theory)**

   * Build a **bottom-up model**: partners × storefronts per partner × GMV × take-rate and/or SaaS seats × ARPA.
   * Identify 5–8 growth levers tied to features (e.g., listing automation → GMV uplift; A2A quoting → higher close rate; storefront templates → faster onboarding).
   * Translate levers into experiments and PMF milestones.

6. **Prioritized roadmap with acceptance**

   * Output a **30/60/90-day plan** plus **Quarter 2–4 themes**.
   * For each item: **Title, Objective, Evidence (file paths), Effort (S/M/L), RICE score, Owner role, Exit criteria, Metrics (P95, error rate, adoption)**.
   * Include **Security & Compliance** (PCI scope, PII storage map), **SLOs** (e.g., P95 API read < 300ms, write < 900ms), and **Rollout plan**.

7. **Deliverables (all required)**

   * **Executive summary** (≤300 words).
   * **System map** (bulleted) + **capability matrix** (table).
   * **Top 12 High-Priority Items** (table with RICE + effort).
   * **30/60/90 roadmap** and **Q2–Q4 theme plan**.
   * **Risk register** (top 10 with mitigations).
   * **Appendix**: API inventory, DB schema deltas, Sanity schema recommendations, Medusa plugin plan, Observability plan.
   * **Machine-readable JSON** of priorities with keys: `id,title,objective,evidence,effort,rice,metrics,exit_criteria`.

**Constraints & quality bar**

* Cite **specific files/lines/functions** for every claim about current behavior.
* Prefer **incremental** changes; avoid rewrites unless ROI is proven.
* Do not expose secrets; mark any `.env`/keys you find.
* Keep total output concise and skimmable; tables where possible.

**Output format**

1. Markdown report with the sections above. use file name "Roadmap&Plan-Gemini.md"
2. A final JSON block named `priorities.json` with the prioritized backlog.
