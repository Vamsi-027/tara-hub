## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Tara Hub platform and a roadmap for its future development. The platform is a multi-tenant fabric marketplace built on Medusa.js and Next.js. It has a solid foundation, but there are a number of gaps that need to be addressed to reach its full potential.

The roadmap is divided into three phases: foundational improvements, core feature development, and advanced features and scaling. The 30-day plan focuses on implementing multi-tenancy, observability, and an optimized file service. The 60-day plan focuses on building out core features like pricing and promotions and inventory management. The 90-day plan focuses on advanced features and scaling.

The top 10 high-priority items are a mix of foundational improvements and new features. The most important item is to implement a robust multi-tenant architecture. Other important items include building an agent core for AI agents, syncing with Etsy, and implementing a flexible pricing and promotions engine.

By following this roadmap, we can build Tara Hub into a leading platform for the fabric industry and achieve our goal of $50M ARR.

## Appendix

### API Inventory

*   `/api/fabrics`: Fetches a list of fabrics.
*   `/api/auth/session`: Fetches the user's session.

### Plugin Configuration

| Plugin | Configuration |
| :--- | :--- |
| `@medusajs/file-s3` | Configured for Cloudflare R2. |
| `@medusajs/notification-sendgrid` | Configured for SendGrid. |
| `@medusajs/payment-stripe` | Configured for Stripe. |

### Database Schema Deltas

*   Add `tenant_id` to all tables to support multi-tenancy.
*   Add tables for price lists, customer groups, stock locations, and reservations.

### R2 File-Service Configuration

*   Use the S3 driver for R2 with the following settings:
    *   `endpoint`: The R2 endpoint.
    *   `access_key_id`: The R2 access key ID.
    *   `secret_access_key`: The R2 secret access key.
    *   `s3ForcePathStyle`: `true`.

### Example Idempotent Handlers

```typescript
import { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/medusa"

export default async (req: MedusaRequest, res: MedusaResponse) => {
  const idempotencyKey = req.headers["idempotency-key"] as string

  const manager = req.scope.resolve("manager")
  const idempotencyKeyService = req.scope.resolve("idempotencyKeyService")

  const headerKey = idempotencyKeyService.getOnboardingState(idempotencyKey)

  let onboardingState = await manager.transaction(async (transactionManager) => {
    return await idempotencyKeyService
      .withTransaction(transactionManager)
      .retrieve(headerKey)
  })

  if (onboardingState) {
    res.status(onboardingState.response_code).json(onboardingState.response_body)
    return
  }

  // ... process request ...

  onboardingState = {
    response_code: 200,
    response_body: { message: "Success" },
  }

  await manager.transaction(async (transactionManager) => {
    await idempotencyKeyService
      .withTransaction(transactionManager)
      .create(headerKey, onboardingState)
  })

  res.status(200).json({ message: "Success" })
}
```
