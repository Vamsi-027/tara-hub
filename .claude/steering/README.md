## Document Structure

### 📍 Start Here
- **[main_steering.md](./main_steering.md)** - Project overview and current state
- **[implementation_status.md](./implementation_status.md)** - What's built vs planned

### 🏗️ Technical Details
- **[architecture_steering.md](./architecture_steering.md)** - Actual system architecture
- **[development_steering.md](./development_steering.md)** - Developer guide and workflows
- **[migration_steering.md](./migration_steering.md)** - Architecture transition guide

### 📊 Analysis Documents
- **[gap_analysis.md](./gap_analysis.md)** - Documentation vs reality analysis
- **[analysis_results.json](./analysis_results.json)** - Automated analysis data

### 🗄️ Legacy Documents (Outdated)
The following documents contain outdated or aspirational information:
- `api.md` - Claims APIs that don't exist
- `features.md` - Lists unimplemented features
- `performance.md` - Aspirational performance targets
- `security.md` - Overstates security features
- `product.md` - Confused business model
- Other legacy docs - Mix of real and fictional

## Quick Facts

### What Tara Hub Actually Is
- **Primary**: Fabric inventory management system
- **Secondary**: Content management for blog/marketing
- **Tertiary**: Basic product catalog

### What It's NOT (Despite Legacy Docs)
- ❌ AI-powered platform
- ❌ Social media management tool
- ❌ Payment processing system
- ❌ Real-time analytics platform

### Technology Reality Check
- ✅ Next.js 15 with Turborepo
- ✅ PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Custom magic link auth
- ✅ Vercel KV caching
- ❌ AI/LLM integration (mocked)
- ❌ Social media APIs (none)
- ❌ Payment processing (Etsy redirect)

## Using These Documents

### For New Development
1. Read `main_steering.md` first
2. Check `implementation_status.md` before implementing features
3. Follow patterns in `development_steering.md`
4. Be aware of migration state per `migration_steering.md`

### For Bug Fixes
1. Verify feature actually exists in `implementation_status.md`
2. Check if it's a mock implementation
3. Follow architecture in `architecture_steering.md`

### For Understanding Gaps
1. Read `gap_analysis.md` for why docs were wrong
2. Check feature matrix in `implementation_status.md`
3. Don't trust legacy documents without verification

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Keeping Documents Current
- Update when implementation changes
- Remove aspirational content
- Date significant updates
- Link to relevant code

### Red Flags in Documentation
- Future tense ("will", "planned")
- Superlatives ("enterprise", "advanced")
- Missing code references
- Technology not in package.json

### When to Update
- After major feature changes
- When architecture shifts
- Before major deployments
- When onboarding new developers

## Document Status Key

- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Checked against code, accurate
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL**: Some accurate, some outdated
- ❌ **OUTDATED**: Do not trust, needs update
- 🔄 **MIGRATING**: In transition, both states exist
