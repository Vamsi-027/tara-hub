## How to Use These Documents

1. **For New Developers**: Start with `product.md` → `tech.md` → `structure.md`
2. **For Feature Development**: Reference `features.md` → `api.md` → `database.md`
3. **For Code Reviews**: Use `structure.md` → `testing.md` → `security.md`
4. **For DevOps**: Focus on `deployment.md` → `performance.md` → `integrations.md`

## Document Standards

Each steering document should:
- Be specific to Tara Hub (not generic templates)
- Include real examples from the codebase
- Be updated when significant changes occur
- Provide actionable guidance

## Adding New Steering Documents

The system is flexible - simply create a new `.md` file in the `.claude/steering/` directory. The steering loader will automatically recognize and load it. Consider creating documents for:
- Specific feature areas
- Complex business logic
- Integration guides
- Migration strategies
- Troubleshooting guides

## Version Control

All steering documents are version controlled. Major updates should include:
- Update date at the top of the document
- Brief changelog or update notes
- Review by team lead or architect
