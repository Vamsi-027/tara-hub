## Actual vs Aspirational Features

### ✅ What's Actually Working
1. **Admin Dashboard**: Fully functional fabric inventory management
2. **Authentication**: Custom magic link system with email delivery
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema and migrations
4. **Monorepo**: Proper Turborepo setup with three Next.js apps
5. **Basic CRUD**: Fabrics, blog posts, products, team management
6. **Import/Export**: CSV bulk operations for fabrics
7. **Caching**: Vercel KV implementation with fallbacks

### ❌ What's Mock/Missing
1. **AI Features**: All AI content generation is fake (setTimeout)
2. **Social Media**: No Instagram/Facebook/Pinterest API integrations
3. **Payments**: No Stripe integration, just Etsy redirects
4. **Real-time**: No WebSocket or live update functionality
5. **Analytics**: Dashboard shows static mock data only
6. **Email Marketing**: No bulk email or campaign features
7. **Multi-tenancy**: Single tenant despite role system

### ⚠️ What's Partially Implemented
1. **Architecture Migration**: Old and new paths coexist (165/??? migrated)
2. **Railway Backend**: Deployed but minimal functionality
3. **Role System**: Defined but not fully utilized
4. **Testing**: Vitest configured but minimal coverage
5. **Performance Features**: Basic caching only, no edge functions

## Code Quality Indicators

### Red Flags Found
- TypeScript/ESLint errors ignored in build
- Mock implementations presented as real features
- Inconsistent branding across apps
- Unused dependencies (NextAuth, AI SDK)
- Placeholder API routes that don't function

### Positive Indicators
- Clean module structure (where implemented)
- Good use of TypeScript and Zod validation
- Professional UI with shadcn/ui components
- Proper error handling in most areas
- Well-structured database schema

## Business Logic Reality

### What This Platform Actually Does
1. **Primary**: Fabric inventory management for admin users
2. **Secondary**: Content planning for blog/marketing
3. **Tertiary**: Basic product catalog management

### What It Doesn't Do (Despite UI Suggestions)
1. Post to social media platforms
2. Generate AI content
3. Process payments
4. Provide real analytics
5. Manage multiple stores/tenants
6. Send marketing emails

## Migration Progress

### Completed Migrations
- 165 import paths updated
- Core module structure created
- Authentication system replaced
- Database schema modernized

### Remaining Work
- Complete import path migration
- Remove legacy directories
- Clean up mock features
- Align app branding
- Implement claimed features or remove UI

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Clean up mock features**: Either implement or remove AI/analytics UI
2. **Complete migration**: Finish moving to module architecture
3. **Remove unused deps**: NextAuth, AI SDK if not needed
4. **Fix build warnings**: Address TypeScript/ESLint issues
5. **Clarify business purpose**: Align three apps under one vision
6. **Document reality**: Update all docs to reflect actual state
