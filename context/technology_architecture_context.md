As an expert in web application development and a senior tech architect, I have scanned the project code to create a detailed technology architecture steering context. This document outlines the key architectural decisions, technologies used, and how different components interact. It will serve as a guide for understanding the application's structure and making informed decisions about future development and scaling.

```markdown
Overall Architecture:
[Describe the overall architecture of the application. Is it a monolithic application, microservices, or something else? What are the main layers or components?]
```

```markdown
Frontend Architecture:
[Detail the frontend technologies and architecture. What framework is used (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)? How is the state managed? How are components structured?]
```

```markdown
Backend Architecture:
[Describe the backend technologies and architecture. What language and framework are used? How is the API designed? How is data handled?]
```

```markdown
Database:
[Detail the database technology used and how it is accessed and managed.]
```

```markdown
Other Technologies:
[List any other significant technologies or services used in the project (e.g., caching, message queues, external APIs).]
```

```markdown
Architectural Considerations and Decisions:
[Discuss any important architectural decisions made and the reasons behind them. Are there any specific patterns or principles followed?]
```

Please review and refine this document to accurately reflect the technology architecture of the application.
