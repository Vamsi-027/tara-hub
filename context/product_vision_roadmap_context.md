# Project Steering Context: Product Vision, Roadmap, and Charter

Based on the analysis of the provided codebase, this document outlines the perceived product vision, a potential roadmap, and key elements of the product charter.

## Product Vision:

This application appears to be a platform for managing and showcasing fabric-related information, potentially aimed at businesses or individuals involved in the textile or design industries. The core purpose seems to be providing a centralized system for listing, detailing, and potentially interacting with different types of fabrics. The target audience likely includes fabric suppliers, designers, manufacturers, or even consumers interested in sourcing specific materials. The unique value proposition lies in offering a structured and accessible way to browse and understand a diverse collection of fabrics, potentially with features for inventory management, design inspiration, or collaborative work.

## Product Roadmap:

Based on the current structure, a potential product roadmap could include:

1.  **Enhanced Fabric Management:** Implement more robust features for adding, editing, and categorizing fabrics, including support for detailed specifications (composition, weight, width, etc.) and high-quality images.
2.  **Search and Filtering:** Develop advanced search and filtering capabilities to allow users to easily find fabrics based on various criteria.
3.  **User Authentication and Profiles:** Introduce user accounts to enable personalized experiences, saved preferences, and potentially features like wishlists or order history (if e-commerce features are planned).
4.  **E-commerce Integration:** Explore the possibility of integrating e-commerce functionalities to allow users to purchase fabrics directly through the platform.
5.  **Community Features:** Consider adding features like fabric reviews, ratings, or forums to foster a community around fabric enthusiasts.
6.  **Integration with Design Tools:** Explore integrations with popular design software to allow for seamless use of fabric information in design workflows.
7.  **Analytics and Reporting:** Implement tools to track fabric popularity, user engagement, and other relevant metrics.
8.  **Mobile Application:** Develop a dedicated mobile application for improved accessibility and user experience on the go.

## Product Charter:

Based on the codebase, the product charter appears to encompass:

*   **Scope:** The application's scope is primarily focused on the management and presentation of fabric data. It includes views for browsing fabrics, viewing details, and potentially administrative functions (like adding new fabrics). There are also modules for posts, products (potentially related to fabric goods), and strategy, suggesting a broader business context.
*   **Goals:** The primary goals seem to be providing a user-friendly interface for exploring fabrics, potentially facilitating discovery and informed decision-making related to fabric selection. The inclusion of admin and strategic views suggests goals related to internal management and business planning.
*   **Constraints/Considerations:** The current implementation suggests a web-based platform built with Next.js and React. The use of specific UI component libraries implies a focus on a modern and responsive user interface. The presence of API routes suggests a backend for data management and potentially integrations with other services. Considerations for future development should include scalability, data security, and user experience for a potentially diverse user base. The structure hints at a possible business model that could involve fabric sales, subscription services, or advertising.
