# Medusa v2 Metadata Exposure - Best Practice Implementation

## Overview
This implementation follows Medusa v2 best practices for exposing product metadata to the storefront through a custom Store API route.

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Custom Store API Route
- **Location**: `/medusa/src/api/store/products-with-metadata/route.ts`
- **Endpoint**: `/store/products-with-metadata`
- **Purpose**: Exposes product metadata safely to the storefront

### 2. Features
- ✅ Follows Medusa v2 architecture patterns
- ✅ Uses proper authentication (publishable key)
- ✅ Supports both single product and list queries
- ✅ Includes all product relations (variants, images, etc.)
- ✅ Properly exposes metadata field

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Medusa Backend

```bash
cd medusa

# Build the backend with the new route
npm run build

# Deploy to your production environment
# For Railway:
railway up

# For other platforms:
npm run start
```

### 2. Update Product Metadata in Medusa Admin

1. Login to Medusa Admin: https://medusa-backend-production-3655.up.railway.app/admin
2. Edit your products
3. In the Metadata section, add:
   ```
   color: Red
   color_family: Red
   color_hex: #DC143C
   pattern: Solid
   composition: 100% Premium Velvet
   width: 54 inches
   durability: 50,000 double rubs
   care_instructions: Professional cleaning recommended
   usage: Indoor
   ```

### 3. Verify the New Endpoint

Test the endpoint is working:
```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://medusa-backend-production-3655.up.railway.app/store/products-with-metadata?id=prod_01K5C2CN06C8E90SGS1NY77JQD" \
  -H "x-publishable-api-key: pk_49ebbbe6498305cd3ec7b42aaedbdebb37145d952652e29238e2a23ab8ce0538"
```

You should see the product with its metadata included.

### 4. Fabric Store Updates

The fabric-store has been updated to use the new endpoint:
- `/app/api/fabrics/route.ts` - Uses `/store/products-with-metadata`
- `/app/api/fabrics/[id]/route.ts` - Uses `/store/products-with-metadata?id={id}`

## How It Works

### Request Flow
1. **Fabric Store** → Makes request to `/api/fabrics`
2. **Fabric API** → Calls Medusa `/store/products-with-metadata`
3. **Medusa Custom Route** → Uses ProductModuleService to fetch products
4. **Response** → Includes full product data WITH metadata
5. **Fabric Store** → Displays color, pattern, and all metadata fields

### Security
- ✅ Uses Store API authentication (publishable key)
- ✅ Only exposes product metadata (not sensitive data)
- ✅ Follows Medusa v2 security best practices

## Metadata Fields Reference

| Field | Type | Example | Usage |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| color | string | "Red" | Display color name |
| color_family | string | "Red" | Filter grouping |
| color_hex | string | "#DC143C" | Color swatch display |
| pattern | string | "Solid" | Pattern information |
| composition | string | "100% Velvet" | Material details |
| width | string | "54 inches" | Fabric width |
| durability | string | "50,000 double rubs" | Durability rating |
| care_instructions | string | "Dry clean only" | Care information |
| usage | string | "Indoor/Outdoor" | Usage type |

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Deploy Medusa backend with new route
- [ ] Verify endpoint at `/store/products-with-metadata`
- [ ] Update product metadata in Medusa Admin
- [ ] Test fabric-store shows correct colors
- [ ] Verify filters work with metadata

## Benefits

1. **Standards Compliant**: Follows Medusa v2 architecture
2. **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns
3. **Scalable**: Works with any number of products
4. **Type-Safe**: Uses Medusa's TypeScript types
5. **Production-Ready**: Proper error handling and authentication

## Troubleshooting

### If metadata doesn't appear:
1. Check the Medusa backend logs for the custom route
2. Verify metadata is set in Medusa Admin
3. Clear any CDN/cache if using one
4. Check browser network tab for API responses

### To test locally:
```bash
# Start Medusa with the new route
cd medusa
npm run dev

# Test the endpoint
curl "http://localhost:9000/store/products-with-metadata" \
  -H "x-publishable-api-key: YOUR_KEY"
```

This is the proper, production-ready way to expose metadata in Medusa v2!
